osu! has a large selection of Featured Artists, whose music are free to download from the osu! website. 
However, they come in the .osz format, which is just a renamed zip file.
This program extracts the .mp3s from .osz files and renames them. 

Instructions:
- Move a number of .osz files *downloaded from the osu! Featured Artists page* to this directory.
- Run the program. 
- If the files use underscores instead of spaces in the file name, type 'y' when prompted, else type 'n' (or anything else really)
- When prompted, type the track number.
